### News
- [June 2020] Dominance properties & polyhedral results in robust scheduling: new preprint
- [May 2020] I attended ISCO 2020 conference online, where I gave a talk on anchored rescheduling problems
- [Nov 2019] Paper accepted to AAAI2020!

### Research interests
Operations Research and Combinatorial Optimization in a broad sense.  
I'm currently working on robust optimization, scheduling, and exact approaches based on integer programming and polyhedral methods.  
I'm also interested in connections with algorithmic game theory and computational social choice.

### PhD thesis
_Anchored solutions in robust combinatorial optimization._  
Under the supervision of Pascale Bendotti (EDF & LIP6), Philippe Chrétienne (LIP6) and Pierre Fouilhoux (LIPN).  
Our objective is to design new robust optimization problems to achieve a trade-off between the cost of the robust solution and guarantees on decisions.
